# Text-Image-Encryption
Description: Developed a Python-based text image encryption project utilizing steganography and the Fernet encryption algorithm. Integrated a user-friendly interface with Tkinter for easy interaction.

Key Features:

Steganography Data Hiding: Implemented steganography techniques to conceal sensitive text data within images, ensuring secure data transmission and protection.

Fernet Encryption: Utilized the Fernet encryption algorithm for symmetric encryption of the hidden text within the image, adding an additional layer of security.

Tkinter GUI: Created a user-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter, enabling seamless navigation and interaction with the encryption process.

Text and Image Compatibility: Ensured compatibility with various text formats and image types, allowing users to work with a wide range of data sources.

Decryption Support: Provided decryption functionality to retrieve the original text from the encrypted image, maintaining data integrity and accessibility.
